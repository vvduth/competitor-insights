# Business Profile Comparator

A full-stack web application that helps restaurant owners and local businesses improve their online visibility by comparing their business profiles against competitors and providing AI-powered recommendations.

## What I Built

### üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand for state management
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with Gemini AI fallback
- **External APIs**: Serper.dev for Google Places data

### ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Business Search & Profile Display
- Real-time business search using Google Places API via Serper.dev
- Comprehensive business profile display with ratings, reviews, hours, amenities
- Clean, responsive UI with proper loading states and error handling

#### 2. Competitor Discovery
- Geographic-based competitor search using lat/lng coordinates
- Competitor selection interface with multi-select capability
- Real-time competitor data fetching and display

#### 3. AI-Powered Analysis
- **Single Business Analysis**: AI recommendations for profile improvements
- **Competitor Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis with strategic insights
- Intelligent fallback system (OpenAI ‚Üí Gemini if rate limited)
- Markdown-formatted responses with proper rendering

#### 4. Dual Comparison Modes
- **Analysis Mode**: Focus on single business optimization
- **Comparison Mode**: Direct competitor benchmarking
- Tabbed interface for clean UX separation

### üéØ Technical Highlights
- **Singleton Pattern**: Centralized AI service with fallback logic
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces across frontend/backend
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
- **State Management**: Clean separation of concerns with Zustand
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper validation

## What I Skipped and Why

### üö´ Intentionally Skipped Features

#### 1. **Profile Scoring/Ranking System**
- **Why**: Would require complex weighting algorithms and industry benchmarks
- **Time Impact**: 4-6 hours for meaningful implementation
- **Priority**: Lower than core comparison functionality

#### 2. **Visual Charts and Graphs**
- **Why**: Focused on AI-powered insights over visual analytics
- **Alternative**: Used clean, readable text-based comparisons
- **Trade-off**: Faster development for better AI integration

#### 3. **User Authentication & Persistence**
- **Why**: Prototype focused on core functionality over user management
- **Scope**: Outside MVP requirements
- **Future**: Easy to add with JWT/session management

#### 4. **Advanced Filtering & Search**
- **Why**: Basic search met core requirements
- **Examples**: Category filters, price range, distance radius
- **Priority**: Enhancement rather than core feature

#### 5. **Review Response Analysis**
- **Why**: Would require review text scraping and sentiment analysis
- **Complexity**: Significant additional API integration
- **Focus**: Kept scope manageable for 1-2 day timeline
